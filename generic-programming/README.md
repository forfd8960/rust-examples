## Rust - Generic arguments three use cases

* Deferred binding of data structures with generic parameters.


* Use generic parameters and PhantomData to declare types that are not directly used in the data structure, but need to be used in the implementation process.

* Use generic parameters to allow the same data structure to have different implementations of the same trait.
